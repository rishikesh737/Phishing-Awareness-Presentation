# Scenario

The table provided helps you to identify which teams appear to be more likely to fall for a phishing email than others.
Analyse the data that is provided and Create a short presentation providing some awareness and training materials for the two teams that appear to be most susceptible. This will help us improve the security awareness of the teams that performed poorly in this campaign.



# Supporting Material 

Team | Open Rate | Click-Through Rate | Phishing Success Rate
-------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------
IT | 80% | 2% | 0%
HR | 100% | 85% | 75%
Card Services | 60% | 50% | 10%
Reception | 40% | 10% | 0%
Engineering | 70% | 4% | 1%
Marketing | 65% | 40% | 38%
R&D | 50% | 5% | 2%
Overall Average | 66% | 28% | 18%

The percentages shown are based off the total number of staff members who received the email. 

For example if 100 people received the email and 50 people opened it - the email open rate would be 50%.

Email open rate = the percentage of people that opened it
Email click-through rate = the percentage of people that clicked on the link
Phishing success rate = the percentage of people that clicked the link and inputted some personal information
